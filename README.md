# tomochan

simple discord bot build as a fun project for my friend, it changes his nickname to `Tomo<something>owsky`

what started as a simple joke quickly evolved into a feature-packed monstrosity with new features being added regularly 😵‍💫

this is (so far) the best thing i've built

## developing/building 

these sections are usually *boooooooring* 🥱

just use `bun dev` for developing and `docker compose up -d` when hosting, don't forget about copying `.env.example` to `.env`, filling it out and you're ready to go 🚀
